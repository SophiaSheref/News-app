# News-app

Created during Week 12 of GW Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. the app should scrape stories from a news website and display them for the user. Each scraped article should be saved to the application database. Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
